<details>
    <summary>
        Ads, banners, popup windows
    </summary>
    Yes, advertising is the engine of commerce, but it is often very intrusive.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        Animated elements. Including unrequested slide animation
    </summary>
    Please, do not flicker. Start the video, animation and gifs only by clicking on them.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        Large logos, large heads with pictures, fancy logos
    </summary>
    Can we start reading and not scrolling through the half-screen head? And yet, tell someone to the designers and their customers that the overwhelming number of all these fancy logos and slogans are no good at all. Sorry.

        *By the way, regarding logos and animations: the opinion of dimisa, one of the authors of Ru Adlist:
    </summary>
The main "indications" for hiding the logos and headers are usually the following: used animation, which spins coolers and the banal saving of screen space. These headers have no functionality other than duplicating the "home" button, but they steal from 100 to 300 pixels of screen space. And while in desktop resolution 1920x1080 this is not critical, in laptop resolution, such as 1366x768, the actual height of the browser window may remain just slightly more than 50% <br>

        Fixed elements, that don't move when scrolling a page
    </summary>
    When all text smoothly goes up, and some button remains nailed down, it looks terrible.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        Moving text stripes (marquee)
    </summary>
    Designer needed more space on the screen? Or is it the echoes of old stock reports?
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        Buttons like "To the top"
    </summary>
    Taking up space and often fixed
</details>

</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        App buttons
    </summary>
    It is obvious that many large sites have their own mobile applications. If the visitor is interested in them, he will find them perfectly in the market. Another question is what quality they are and how much they are needed.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        Links to add to favorites
    </summary>
    It is a standard function of a browser, visual garbage is not needed.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        Subscription forms (enter email, subscribe to our materials)
    </summary>
    A good feature, but relevant only on a separate page of the site. And most likely, they will send any little meaningful spam.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        Large and expanded by default answer forms
    </summary>
    In general, these are useful things, but often designers make them very cumbersome and disturbing. In an amicable way, it should be either a small form, or expanded by click element. So far, a part of the large form removed, with the hope of a better solution in the future.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        Large and expanded by default search form
    </summary>
    It should be a pretty small form, or you can use instead Google/Yandex/Bing.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        Bulky forms of content (TOC)
    </summary>
    Are you reading a book from the table of contents? Ok, we see headlines, please let us move on to the material for which we came.

        Warnings about cookies and GDPR
    </summary>    
    We understand that you want to meet the requirements of European regulators, but these windows do not carry useful information.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        Warnings about age
    </summary>
    Is that legal requirements or stupidity of web designers? But it looks pretty ridiculous.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        Offers to register
    </summary>
    Button/link in the menu is enough.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        Survey or feedback forms
    </summary>
    "Your feedback is very important to us*"? 
    <br> *In fact, quite rare.

        In online stores: blocks of viewed products
    </summary>
    We do not suffer from memory loss. And, perhaps, this time we came to look at completely different products than last time.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        In blogs: expanded blocks "about the author", self-promotion
    </summary>
    Button/link in the menu is enough. It is not necessary to push the reader your portrait on each page.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        In online stores: payment methods
    </summary>
    Most often with icons of payment systems. This is such a rare event - online payment by credit card!
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        In online stores: brand listings
    </summary>
    All in a row, yes. Terribly helpful.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        Fixed top, bottom, side buttons
    </summary>
    Usually this is done by online shops. Search engines are allowed to fix the string, the rest, sorry, no. There is not much space on the screen.

    <summary>
        Sites that mimic the well-known services, phishing
    </summary>
    That is, pretending that you have logged on to Facebook, for example, and prompting you to enter a password. Scammers, in general. And there are many of these scam sites. In fact, the best defense against fraudsters is common sense.

        Microfinance organizations, online casinos
