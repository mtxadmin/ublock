Lists of closed domains.

Closed means completely absent in DNS, not just parked. I've seen parked domains with ad scripts and/or subdomains inside

These domains do not include in blocklists, they are here just for technical purposes. Most of them are unneeded and dead, but they can suddenly revive. From time to time they are rechecked, and revived domains returned to active blocking lists with a # zombie tag.
